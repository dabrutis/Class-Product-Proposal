    <h1>Spotify Song IQ</h1>
    <h2>David Abrutis</h2>
    <p>Quiz application according to personal or general Spotify songs/albums/artists selections.</p>
    <p>Hosted through Azure, either a static or node.js website, and uses Spotify API for 
        information about songs/albums/artists. Possibly using a database for high scores. 
        HTML, CSS, and Javascript for languages, possible use of something like Bootstrap for its architecture.</p>
    <p>The proposal was last updated on 11/5/2023.</p>
    <p>Features include the fetching of Spotify API JSON information to create a quiz-type 
        application that will test the end userâ€™s knowledge of certain aspects of the music industry. 
        The initial idea is to ask the user to guess what the most popular songs of an artist are and 
        add together the points for a final score. Another idea would be to guess what album or artist a song is from.</p>
    <p>If there was more time, use authentication to personalize the quizzes.</p>
    <p>Basic technical features are hosting a website, and making use of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and APIs to create the app.</p>
    <p>Advanced technical features would be using a node.js based website to host server-side functionality and a database server to store scores.</p>
