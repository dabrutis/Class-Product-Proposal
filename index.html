    <h1>Spotify Song IQ</h1>
    <h2>David Abrutis</h2>
    <p><b>Application Overview: </b>Quiz application according to personal or general Spotify songs/albums/artists selections.</p>
    <p><b>Technology Overview: </b>Hosted through Azure, either a static or node.js website, and uses Spotify API for 
        information about songs/albums/artists. Possibly using a database for high scores. 
        HTML, CSS, and Javascript for languages, possible use of something like Bootstrap for its architecture.</p>
    <p><b>Last Updated: </b>The proposal was last updated on 11/10/2023.</p>
    <p><b>Feature List: </b>Features include the fetching of Spotify API JSON information to create a quiz-type 
        application that will test the end userâ€™s knowledge of certain aspects of the music industry. 
        Could be any number of unique quiz ideas, however the most prominent ones are ordering albums in chronological order,
        guessing the genre of a song, guessing the song based off lyrics, and so on. The idea is to implement at least one of the ideas, 
        and hopefully more if time permits.</p>
    <p><b>Future Feature List: </b>If there was more time, use authentication to personalize the quizzes.</p>
    <p><b>Basic Technicaly Features: </b>Basic technical features are hosting a website, and making use of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and APIs to create the app.</p>
    <p><b>Advanced Technical Features: </b>Advanced technical features would be using a node.js based website to host server-side functionality and a database server to store scores.</p>
